Sometimes it's just easier to get stuff to work. Especially shit you won't be sharing.

There's a bug in the gradle-ssh-plugin that isn't working w/ passphrases and ssh-agents. So the password is right there for all to see.

C'est la vie.


To get this to work:
* Create a `password` file that just has the password in it.
* Copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa to this folder.
